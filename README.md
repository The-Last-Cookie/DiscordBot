# DiscordBot
This is a programmed Discord bot for your own use. It is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0. You can download, edit and copy it for your own use. I would really appreciate it if you would link to my profile and not to say that it's your own work.

If you want to use the bot, you have to get a token and put it in the variable token in the Static.java file. The bot also posts a message in a specific guild when a new member joins the Discord server. Either you create a channel on your server and insert the channel id in GuildMemberJoin.java or comment the whole class out.

Commands:

-help
You get a view over all commands

-info
Gives out information about a specific user

-ping
Gives back 'Pong!' and the current ping

-tooglefilter
I've implemented a word filter which is designed to delete messages with bad words.
With this command you can turn the filter on or off

If you want to show me what you created out of my program, you surely can do so! I'm always happy to see which kind of commands and things people programmed.

Have fun!
